                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Federico, a dedicated computer science student at Virginia Tech with an anticipated graduation date of December 2024.
                    Ever since I've been introduced to programming, I have been completely captivated by its power to solve problems and create innovative solutions. 
                    During my time at Virginia Tech, I have never stopped exploring new concepts and emerging technologies to expand my knowledge and skills.
                    From algorithms and data structures to artificial intelligence and systems programming, I have always welcomed every challenge this major has brought upon me.
                    My ultimate goal is to leverage my education and experiences to create a mutually beneficial relationship between myself, a company, and consumers. 
                    I'm excited to embark on this journey of growth and discovery!
                </p>

                <h2 class="subheader_about_me">My experiences</h2>
                <p>
                    My software engineering journey began at W.T. Woodson High School in Fairfax, VA. Here, I was introduced to computer science through courses I took during my Junior and Senior year; once I got accepted
                    into Virginia Tech, I had no doubt that I would choose to major in Computer Science. Througout my first three years at Virginia Tech, I completed my required courses: Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Organization, 
                    various math and science courses, Computer Systems, and some interesting CS related electives; I credit these classes for giving me the fundemental knowledge that is necessary to succeed in this field. After my Junior year,
                    I was lucky enough to have gotten an internship offer at Amazon. This internship was my most formative experience to date. I was able to work alongside some of the best engineers I've ever met and I learned how to use
                    many technologies that I had no previous exposure to. However, the biggest lesson I learned was: there is a difference between being a good programmer and a good engineer, a good engineer practices daily habits that enable
                    large teams to work together and sees his or her problem scope further out than just the code they are typing. As I am finishing up my college education, I have picked up a job as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for Introduction
                    to Artificial Intelligence; this is a great way for me to exercise my ability to explain concepts from different angles. Moving forward, I am in the search for an internship for the summer of 2024.

                <p>
                    When I'm not immersed in the world of computer science, you can often find me pursuing my other passions and interests.
                </p>
                <h3>Jiu-Jitsu</h3>
                <p>
                    One of my greatest passions is jiu-jitsu. I've been practicing this martial art for several years now and am proud to hold a blue belt. Jiu-jitsu not only keeps me physically fit but also teaches me valuable lessons about discipline, perseverance, and respect.
                </p>
                <h3>Fishing</h3>
                <p>
                    Another activity that brings me joy and relaxation is fishing. I typically choose to fly fish, and I love it due to the fact that it not only brings me closer to nature, but it gives me uninterupted time with my friends and family. 
                </p>
                <h3>Cooking</h3>
                <p>
                    When I'm not on the mat or by the water, you'll often find me in the kitchen, experimenting with new recipes and flavors. Cooking serves as a way for me to not only be able to fuel my body correctly, but also as a way to show my loved ones that I appreciate them through a well prepared meal.
